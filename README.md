give us a pip line  to do this:

appSink is a important conept for manipulating frames

With all that background in mind, let's jump into the code. Now, we're going to be writing in Python but the GStreamer library is written in C so we're going to be using what's called a "binding". A binding is simply a library that allows you to use a library in one language from another language. GStreamer's Python binding library is called PyGObject, and we import it like this:

import gi
Now we need to tell PyGObject the minimum version of GStreamer that our program requires, which the library shortens to "Gst". Once we've done that, we're ready to import the "Gst" module, as well as the "GLib" module which we will use shortly. Make sure to call Gst.init() to initialize GStreamer before doing anything else.

gi.require_version("Gst", "1.0")

from gi.repository import Gst, GLib


Gst.init()


After that, we need to start the main loop. The main loop is in charge of handling events and doing some other background tasks. Here we'll start it in a new thread, so that we can do other things in our main thread.

from threading import Thread

main_loop = GLib.MainLoop()
thread = Thread(target=main_loop.run)
thread.start()



with appsink. We're going to give the element a name so that we can pull this element out of the pipeline and interact with it.
the tricky part is to import GstApp even if not used

from gi.repository import Gst, GLib ,GstApp

_ = GstApp

pipeline = Gst.parse_launch("ksvideosrc ! decodebin ! videoconvert ! "
                            "appsink name=sink")
appsink = pipeline.get_by_name("sink")
Now, we can pull images out of the appsink using the try_pull_sample method.

try:
    while True:
        sample = appsink.try_pull_sample(Gst.SECOND)
        if sample is None:
            continue
    
        print("Got a sample!")
except KeyboardInterrupt:
    pass
